## Hi there 👋 
 I'm Niranjan — a hands-on tech enthusiast passionate about IoT, DIY electronics, and Machine Learning. I love troubleshooting, building smart devices, and exploring how technology can improve everyday life.

My journey began with small Arduino experiments and evolved into automating appliances with ESP8266 and creating ML models during my engineering degree. I enjoy bringing ideas to life with code, sensors, and a bit of creative wiring.

I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can contribute my skills, learn from real-world challenges, and grow in the field of IoT and embedded systems.
